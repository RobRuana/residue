    """
    Fills in missing date "buckets" for an aggregate query grouped by date.

    Aggregate queries grouped by date are often used for generating reports,
    like "How many widgets did I sell on each day of last month?" These queries
    often look similar to this::

        SELECT date_of_sale AS day, count(id) AS sales_count
        FROM sales
        WHERE date_of_sale > now() - interval '1 month'
        GROUP BY day ORDER BY day;

    This kind of query will ONLY return days that contain at least one sale.
    Days with zero sales will not be returned at all, leaving gaps in the
    report. To combat this, we can normalize the query by generating a UNION
    with a Postgres date series::

        SELECT date_of_sale AS day, coalesce(sales_count, 0) AS sales_count
        FROM (
          SELECT date_of_sale AS day, count(id) AS sales_count
          FROM sales
          WHERE date_of_sale > now() - interval '1 month'

        UNION
          SELECT
            generate_series(now() - interval '1 month', now(), '1 day') AS day,
            0 AS sales_count
        ) AS union_query ORDER BY union_query.day;

    Args:
        query (sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query): The original query grouped by date,

            column.label(date_label), and the "aggregate" column is labelled
            using column.label(report_label).
        date_label (str): The label used to label the "group by date" column.
        report_label (str): The label used to label the "aggregate" column.
        start_date (datetime): Start date of the query.
        end_date (datetime): End date of the query.
        interval (str): Alternately, the length of time from either
            `start_date` or `end_date` expressed as a Postgres interval.
            Defaults to '1 month'.
